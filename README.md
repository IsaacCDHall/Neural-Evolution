### Description

######  May 3rd
  * 8-10am General Discovery
  * 10-11am Narrow in what is actually possible for me to learn and complete within the time limit
  * 11-12am Got sucked into a stackOverflow thread regarding efficiency of a basic genetic algorithm
  * 12am-1:20pm Grabbed lunch
  * 1:20 - 230pm Found a great youtube series earlier today that I followed along with. This will serve as my primary inspiration with my specific code
  * 2:30 - 3:30pm Fiddled around with a neat tool called p5.js. It's a neat library useful for creating interactive graphics on a canvas. I believe this will be what I use to manipulate data on the page
  * 330 - 430pm Read around parts of Daniel Shiffman's *Nature of Code* book. This is mostly out of my depth, however, there are some interesting things I could utilize(e.g., Neural network, vector motion, and **definitely** pg. 411 regarding smart rockets - DNA geneotype and rocket phenotype)
  * I have a lot ahead of me in this project, specifically relating to fitness, selection and reproduction manipulating coded DNA classes. Today has greatly improved my sense of direction!

######  May 10th
  * 8-11am P5.js canvas docs follow along
  * 11-12am Research ways to represent DNA visually
  * 11-12am Codepen infinite monkey theorem
  * 12am-1:05pm lunch
  * 1:05 - 2pm Continue with infinite monkey theorem, specifically DNA fitness algorithm
  * 2 - 4pm Research use of fitness in GA in other applications.
  * 4 - 445pm Continue with researching using Daniel Shiffman's *Nature of Code* book.
  * It's looking good! (better)
  
###### July 19th
  * 8-11am General Discovery, Neural Networks 
  * 11-1205 Look for ways in which I can improve upon my current GA's
  * 12am-1:10 lunch
  * 1:10pm Study implementation of NN's in other javascript projects
  * 2 - 4pm Determine final project idea which will be a blend of many different kinds of projects I've seen
  * 4 - 455pm Continue with researching using Chapter 10 of Daniel Shiffman's *Nature of Code* book
  
 ######  July 26
  * 8-11am Spent the first part of today looking for ways in which I could implement python to an exisiting react site. This way, I could import libraries such as Tensor Flow (The js version is apparently very lackluster with little documentation)
  * 11-12am Attempt to code in python but end up spending most of this time reverting changes after it does not work
  * 12am-1:10pm Food Time
  * 1:10 - 230pm React Redux Flask project, forked this to my github and begin dissecting/playing around in the environment
  * 2:30 - 3:30pm Dive into tensor flow documentation
  * 330 - 430pm Pytorch Documentation
  * 4:30 - 5 Update Readme with progress here. Honestly, this is only the beginning of the journey still
  
###### July 29th
  * Create Flappy bird in flappy directory. I will inject AI with the help of Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms. Once this project is complete within it's quarantined directory, i will implement into the main code
